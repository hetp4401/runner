# More replicas than machines: every machine gets a copy first, then the least busy machines get a second one, with
# its published ports moved aside; the Worker's routes know both; lowering the count drops the extra copies; a copy
# can be moved by replica number onto a machine that already has one; an app that can't run twice on a machine waits
# and says why. Each line says ok, or WRONG.
