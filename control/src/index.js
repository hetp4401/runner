// Control plane for the runner fleet: one Node process with a SQLite file (see ../server.mjs), reached through its own
// Cloudflare tunnel at runners.<domain>. Cloudflare provides nothing else: the machines' tunnels and the DNS names.
// It knows nothing about where machines come from; see the agent's settings for what a machine tells it.
// Holds the project specs (a docker compose file plus any Dockerfiles and build files) and sends every change to all
// machines. Machines find it, not the other way round: any agent joins at /api/join, gets the lowest free slot n and
// the token for tunnel runner-<n> (created through the Cloudflare API the first time a slot is used), then checks in
// at /api/sync. The agent describes its machine; this never knows what's behind it:
//   pool     the name of a replaceable set it belongs to (the control plane keeps each pool at its size), or none
//            for a standalone host that keeps its slot across restarts
//   starts   whether it can start machines: pool members that can are asked to start missing peers and their own
//            replacements; for the rest, whatever watches the pool asks /api/claim
//   label    a name for it, shown on the pages
//   leaving  on its last check-in, when it's going for good (its replicas are placed elsewhere at once)
// and whatever runs the machine pings POST /api/drain when it's going down soon (a timer, a cron before
// maintenance, a cloud termination notice): the control plane then hands the machine over, one at a time, the same
// way as for a requested roll. Nothing here predicts lifetimes.
// It also keeps DNS in line: the public URL of replica k, <project>-<k>.<domain>, is a CNAME to the tunnel of the
// machine running that copy, moved when the copy moves (replicas are numbered 1 to N and keep their number, so these
// URLs only change with the replica count). There's no shared URL in front of a project's replicas, and nothing in
// between: the machine's router answers the replica's name itself.
//   /            the UI (everything public)  /api/*        API: apps are open to everyone (deploying, changing, removing),
//                                                          unless an app was locked with its app password, which its

//                                                          machines send the join token (Bearer): join/sync/claim/drain/roll
//   PUT /api/projects/<name>/env  the app's env: {KEY: "value"} sets, {KEY: null} removes. Every copy gets it as its
//                                 .env (compose reads ${VAR} from it; env_file: .env passes it into containers), along
